# countries-google-maps
A simple scraping tool to get all countries' flags images into a google sheets document.


## WHY
I was doing a Sporkle quiz with a friend on countries, capital cities and country flags.
After only a satisfactory result, we decided we wanted to train ourselves to do better by creating a shared document (Google sheet - GS) to check off countries we know. / don't know.

## HOW

I managed to find a list of countries and capital cities online, but not flags - and even so, the flags would not appear in GS unless you manually formatted them.

At this point, I decided to automate the process and built this scraper to do so.
